    <p>Here’s the thing about tech: it’s not nearly as hard as it seems if you’re creative or a problem solver by nature. If you love to figure out and fix a dilemma or obstacle, then a coding career is likely your dream. Or, if you’re able to create digital work that’s unique and appealing, a creative tech career can be for you. And the best thing about both? Most tech careers can be done remotely from anywhere in the world.
